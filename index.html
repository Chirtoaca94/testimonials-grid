							program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They
							were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance.
							The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my
							learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever
							have. In fact, I've often referred to it during interviews as an
							example of my development experience. It certainly helped me land
							a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers.
							100% recommend!
